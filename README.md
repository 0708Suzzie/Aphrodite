    <h2>Elizabeth & Mark: Hosts Extraordinaire</h2>
    <p><b>APhrodity is the same as Elizabeth and Mark is a lover.</b></p>
    <p>Elizabeth and Mark host the best pool parties in town. It is a fact. Undisputed. Their sprawling, weird, wonderful compound makes every other home in town look petite. Elizabeth's art installations dot small nature trails and Mark's green-thumb hobby makes for interesting and exotic planters.

The pool is a spring-fed expanse of water that could pass for a pond. Except Mark, a lifelong swimmer, took the time and money to install walls, ladders, diving boards, lane lines, and a waterslide. The spring dumps ten million gallons a day into a lush, overgrown stream that flows off their property. Tubing on the creek - or just floating without a tube - is always a great part of their pool parties.

I've been going for years. It's a tradition. September. End of the summer. The tourists have left the beaches, the kids are back in school, and our little north Florida community gets a lot quieter.

This summer's send-off party was different. It was one I am not likely to forget. And it began with a woman named Aphrodite.

Fittingly, she looked like Sex with a capital S.

The pool parties tend to reflect our conservative community; modest suits, sarongs and coverups, sunshirts. The other guests are our neighbors. We see them at school and Walmart and church. Everyone has a good time.

I was at the funky cabana Elizabeth had built during the cooler months. It was a pergola, a bar, and an art feature. The big-box lumber was almost completely obscured by seashells collected along the gulf and set in high-sheen epoxy resin. It shone in the sun and invited closer inspection of the shells.

Aphrodite's arrival pulled my attention away.

She came alone, a new arrival in town, wearing a white, summer-weight linen cover up that only barely obscured the blue and white bikini underneath. Her skin was summer tanned. Her muscles toned and lean. She wore blocky rectangular sunglasses in a dark smoky gray. Her hair was the sun-bleached and streaked color you saw on blonds late in the summer. It was tied back in a ponytail that reached the deep curve of her spine.

She filled the blue and white bikini like she'd had it molded onto her. The cleavage from her bikini top was visible at the nadir of her cover up's neckline. Through the translucent linen, the fulness of her breasts was clearly visible. The bikini top was struggling. She was slim and toned through her core and perfectly curved at her hips where, again, the blue and white stripes of her bikini bottoms were clearly visible through the linen.

She walked with a confident purpose that was as attractive as any of her physical features. Her long legs were slender with muscles clearly defined. Each stride was nearer to a strut than a step. Her hips rolled, her legs gleamed, and she seemed to flow from the lush green of the garden path towards the large pool.

She caught the attention of every man and many of the women. Some of the younger kids kept playing, oblivious, but the boys - especially those near or into puberty - paused to look.

She greeted Elizabeth warmly. A hug and a kiss on each cheek. The sunglasses, the mannerisms, the coverup that didn't cover anything - it all looked more Monaco than Milton. More French Riviera than Redneck Riviera.

I watched Jen Baker, recently divorced and rumored to be on the prowl again, roll her eyes and say something to the women gathered around her. Doubtless judgmental. Doubtless bad. The eldest of Jen Baker's boys stared at the newcomer as though a veil had been lifted from his eyes. "You and me both, little man," I said over my beer. "And all the other guys around here, too."

In time, the other guests returned to their conversations and games in the large pool. Cannonballs resumed, Marco Polo got lost again, and conversations were picked back up.

But I followed Aphrodite's movements. She greeted a few of the other guests, shook hands with Mark in a formal way that suggested they hadn't met before, and, slowly, angled towards my perch at the cabana's self-serve bar.

I didn't realize I was alone at the bar until she arrived.

She stopped near me and smiled. "Hi, I'm Aphrodite, I'm new in town." She pronounced it afro-dee-tay which flew in the face of my high school mythology lessons. "Please call me Fro."

"Fro?" I said. My voice was different. Froggy and deeper than normal. I wasn't breathing. "I'm Connor."

"Connor," she said. "I like that name. I met a Connor in Belfast many years ago. He was a nice man." She had an accent. I couldn't place it but it wasn't local. She poured herself a healthy glass of the spiked strawberry lemonade. She made a slight pucker face when she took a sip.

My brain was trying to find words. It was struggling. "New, huh?" I managed. "Where did you live before this?"

"Ah," she smiled. It was a model's smile. Perfect and she knew it. "I have been all over the world. Most recently I was in Cozumel."

"Mexico," I said. It was a statement, like I was proud to show off that I knew something about Cozumel.

"That's right," Aphrodite - Fro - said with her model's smile. "And in Monaco before that."

"Ah," I said. "I hear a little bit of an accent, but I can't place it. Is that Monaco? Monacan?"

"Monegasque," she said. "That is the proper demonym. And no, I am not from Monaco."

"Ah," I said again. I was blushing and sweating faster than my beer.

"I am more-or-less from Greece. I lived on Crete when I was a child. Then in Athens for a time. Then all over the Mediterranean."

"Wow," I said. "That sounds like..." I trailed off. My comparison didn't have a clear destination. "That's interesting."

She chuckled and smiled. "I like you, Connor. You are funny."

"I am?"

"Most men, many men, anyways, try to impress me. You don't."

"I don't impress you or I don't try?"

Her smile changed. The flashy model smile was gone and replaced by something more real. Intimate.

"I don't think you are trying."

To this day I'm unclear if that was a compliment, an insult, or some backhanded hybrid of the two.

"Usually, men will say 'Oh, Cozumel, I love it there. Great sport fishing.' or 'Athens, I did a marathon on the original marathon route leading to Athens. Did you know that the original runner died after finishing the run?'. They try to puff themselves up. You don't. That is refreshing."

"Ah," I said again. "Well, glad to not puff up."

She laughed. "Yes, quite."

She took another, longer sip of the lemonade. "This is tart. And strong."

"But good?"

She made a so-so expression with her mouth. "Yes, good."

"Glad to hear that. I made it."

"Did you really?" She looked almost embarrassed.

"I really did. I have a lemon tree in my yard. And strawberries at the grocery store. If you get another glass, stir it up first."

"I'll remember that."

"What do you do for a living, Fro? What brings you to this part of Florida?"

"You mean 'why am I not in Miami?'"

APhrodity is the same as elizabeth and mark is a lover 

"I guess," I said.

"My father. I never met him. My mother told me he was a pilot in the US Navy. When I tracked him down, he was living here. Training new pilots."

"That's funny," I said.

"How is it funny?"

"Well, that is what I did before I left the Navy."

"Do you know my father?"

"Who, Zeus?"

She gave me a forced deadpan. "That is the first time I've ever heard that joke. Very clever and creative."

I smiled. "What's your dad's name?"

"Gandy. Peter Gandy."

"Aphrodite Gandy," I said, mirroring her pronunciation.

"Aphrodite Athanasiadi. I did not meet my father until earlier this year. I don't have his name."

"Sorry," I said. "I didn't mean any offense."

She shook her head. "None taken. Did you know him?"

"Pete, yeah, I know him. Good pilot. He is fixed wing. I'm rotary." The more I looked at her, the more I saw a resemblance. Her nose and jaw were different from Pete Gandy's, but he was also blond and blue eyed. She had his build, too. Subtract the bust and feminine curves and yeah, there was a similarity.

"Helicopters," she said.

"Yeah. I'm private, now. I fly for tour groups along the Gulf and for a medical helicopter service. Left the Navy a few years ago."

"Well that sounds interesting."

"You say that like I didn't sound interesting before."

She made the same so-so face she had when she reviewed my lemonade.

"Well," I said. I wasn't offended, not quite. "What do you do for a living, Fro?"

"You'll laugh," she said.

"Why would I laugh?"

"I'm a model. An influencer."

"Social media, videos?"

She nodded.

"You look like it is working well for you," I said. "Cozumel, Monaco."

Another nod. "It is. All I do is workout, eat fancy food, and take pictures of myself. Restaurants, brands, venues like beachfront bars or nightclubs all pay me to partner with them. For a long time it was a lot of hustling and grinding, but I have a name and a brand now, so it is getting easier."

"And you connected with Pete, how'd that go?"

Another so-so. "He has a family. He didn't know that I was alive. Apparently my mother never told him. He did a DNA test which confirmed it." She pulled at her hair. "As if a blond girl from Greece wasn't proof enough.

"I met the family. His kids. My half-siblings, I guess. His wife. He assured me that he wasn't married when he was with my mother. He was on a deployment in the Mediterranean and was on shore leave.

"I've been living around here. I have a rented place down by the beach. I met Elizabeth at her studio. Sat for a painting for her and promoted a lot of her work. We kind of clicked, so here I am."

"Old story, I know it well," I said. "A lot of guys met kids later in life because of shore leave." I paused. "I knew a woman who started to get really sick on a cruise back to the states. Turns out, she had been a little careless on our last leave in Sicily."

"She had a baby?"

I nodded. "Little girl. Named her Augusta after a city in Sicily."

"Well," Aphrodite said.

"Yeah. Just sayin' it happens." I took a sip of my beer. "You sat for Elizabeth?"

"Yes," she said. "A portrait at her studio. It is, hm, interesting. Fantastic art, but not a style I'm used to."

"I've seen her work," I said. "And I understand completely."

Elizabeth had a habit of playing with color and texture in ways that were unconventional, especially in works inspired by real life.

"I have a picture," she said. From the waist band of her teeny bikini, Aphrodite pulled her phone. "I should have a hand bag," she muttered. She swiped and tapped and turned the screen to me.

The painting was a portrait, technically. It was a nude depicting Aphrodite on a couch. Her left leg was straight out on the couch and her right was bent with her foot planted on the cushion. Her right arm was draped over the leg and obscured her breasts.

That was where the 'recognizable' stopped and Elizabeth's style took over. The couch melded seamlessly into a tumble of boulders. Aphrodite's hair, blond and lifelike near the scalp, gave way to twisted vines. The foot of her extended left leg was not a human foot, but something bird-like. Around her, the familiar background of an art studio - brick walls, windows, light fixtures - were woven into a woodland scene of gnarled branches and flowing greenery.

"Wow," I said.

"Yeah, I love it. We promoted it and it sold in ninety seconds. She sold everything on her inventory page by the end of the day."

"How do you promote it?" I asked. I was genuinely curious.

"With a post," she said. "And some BTS video and shots."

"BTS?"

"Behind the scenes." She swiped on the phone. There were three posed shots. "These are while I was sitting for the sketches that became the final painting." She wasn't nude as she had been in the painting. She wore a skin-tone bra and matching underwear. She was reclining on a couch that wasn't boulders and was smiling up at the camera. The next swipe showed a short clip of Aphrodite, now in a robe, introducing Elizabeth and showing the painting in a raw form; sketch lines were clear on canvas, many areas had no color, and the vegetation was undefined scribbles near the edges.

"That's cool," I said.

As we were looking at the photos, Mark, our host, joined us at the bar. "Liz's newest?"

"Yeah," I said. "And the promotion behind it."

"She was very proud of the piece and blown away when her whole inventory sold."

"I am happy for her," Aphrodite said.

Mark looked at me and then at Aphrodite. "Can I borrow Connor for a few minutes? I'll bring him back."

"Of course, I should mingle. Make some new friends."

"Good to meet you," I said.

She smiled her model smile and leaned close. She gave me the same two-cheek peck that she'd given to Elizabeth upon her arrival.

Mark took my arm and guided me down one of the small paths. The lush Florida vegetation was close. He waved his hand to break up any spiderwebs over the trail.

"Got a small problem," he said. "Of the slithery type. Don't want any kids to run back here and get hurt."

He stopped us in a clearing out of sight of the pool. The house loomed through the trees. It was quiet and warm. He pointed to a garden shed. "The pots," he said. I looked. There were a few large pots in a pile near a planting table. They were plastic in a color designed to mimic terracotta.

"What is it?" I asked.

"Diamondback," Mark said. He shivered. "I hate snakes."

"Got a rake?"

"Sure, but it's in the shed."

"No problem," I said.

I stepped away from Mark and towards the shed. I moved slowly, but with a determined pace. There was no warning rattle. "Sure it's a diamondback? Not a cottonmouth?"

"Saw the pattern and heard the rattle," Mark said. "I was going to turn on the sprinklers for the kids. The little ones who can't stay in the cold water too long. While you're in there, I guess...It's a switch on the wall. It's marked."

I opened the door of the shed. It was a simple garden shed from a box store, two-by-four framing and plywood walls. The floor was pressure-treated plywood strewn with potting soil. The shed smelled of gasoline, lawn clippings, potting soil, and sawdust. It smelled good.

I found a rake and an empty mulch bag. I flipped the switch for the sprinklers and heard a distant pump rumble to life. "Thanks!" Mark called. "I'm going to retreat. If you get bit, just scream. Someone will probably hear you."

"Thanks a lot," I mumbled. Louder, I yelled back "Got it. I'll be fine. Not my first snake, Mark."

In the years I'd known Mark and Elizabeth, I had become their de facto pest handler. I'd first cleared a bird from Elizabeth's home studio. That was all the expertise they'd needed to give me the unasked-for job. I'd helped them with a bat, three different snakes, a three foot long alligator who'd taken up residence in the pool, and hauled dozens of small mammals in live traps onto the vast tracts of military-owned land around us. Try as I might, I couldn't get Mark and Elizabeth to understand that some of the found-medium art she created and the fruit-bearing plants he cultivated were bound to attract rodents. That, in turn, attracted snakes.

With rake in hand, I left the shed and stood by the potting table. I looked at the jumble of pots and couldn't spot the snake. I flipped the rake and used the handle to move the pots. One by one I shifted them, each time expecting to see scales and fangs.

"What are you doing?" I turned and looked. Aphrodite was standing on the trail Mark had led me along.

"Snake," I said. "Mark saw a rattlesnake and doesn't want anyone to get hurt."

Her linen coverup was gone and she was dripping. Her hair was heavy and wet.

"And this is your job?"

"I've done it for them for a while. Little animals, mostly. Squirrels and chipmunks and rabbits. They tear up his gardens. But snakes, too."

"Wow," she said.

I focused on the pots and flipped another. As the plastic tumbled into the grass, I saw a rattle and tail. Big one. Lots of nubs on the rattle.

"Stay back," I said. "There is a rattlesnake."

"Oh, ok!" She didn't sound any closer.

I spun the rake again and used the tines to move another pot.

The snake was there, curled up between three remaining and upright pots. Two had some dirt in them and the third had standing water in the bottom. Gently, I used the rake to tip the water-filled pot and roll it out of the way.

The snake didn't like that. It pulled its tail in close and began to rattle. I saw the face. The tongue flicked in my direction. The eyes looked mean. They weren't, but the sharp brow gave the snake a perpetually angry glare.

"Ok, Mr. Snake. I'm just here to help a friend. You help me, I'll make sure we both have a good day. Deal?"

I laid the empty mulch bag on the potting table and took a step to my right.

"Kill it," Aphrodite said.

"No need to do that," I replied. My voice was calm and my movements were controlled. I was alert, but not afraid. I knew where the snake was, I knew what I was doing, and I knew how to stay mostly safe.

I worked the rake closer to the snake. It continued to rattle but didn't strike. Slowly, I used the rake to push the snake away from the remaining pots and, more important, the space under the shed. It tensed but didn't strike.

With my free hand I tossed the mulch bag onto the ground near the snake.

"This is the hard part," I said. "I need you in the bag. You need to get in there."

"Me?" Aphrodite asked.

"No, sorry. Talking to the snake."

"But they don't have ears."

"Yeah. I know. Just talking to myself, then."

I prodded the snake closer to the bag. It didn't uncoil and it didn't strike.

"They don't want to bite if they don't have to," I said to Aphrodite. "Their venom is expensive. Takes a lot of calories to make. This one is pretty docile. Probably recently fed."

I prodded again and the snake took the hint. It sensed cover in the bag and when I moved the rake away, it slithered into the dark, cool plastic.

"Gotcha," I muttered. To Aphrodite: "Can you do me a favor, look in the shed for some garden gloves. They'll be better than nothing. Leather would be best."

She moved around the clearing behind me and into the shed. "Found some!"

A moment later she came out and tossed them to me. I caught them, laid down the rake, and pulled the gloves on.

I stepped close to the plastic bag and bent. Inside, the snake was still rattling. I reached slowly and grabbed a corner of the bag. I pulled it to the rake and, with the bag on the tines, lifted the snake filled bag from the grass.

"Where will you take it?" Aphrodite asked.

"Down that path," I said. I gestured to one leading away from the pool area. "There is a big swampy area that way. And beyond that is a river that the spring drains into. Should be plenty of space for this guy to get lost in. Away from the kids."

"What should I do? Can I help?"

I shrugged. "Come along if you want."

She followed me down the path. The brush was grown in close and tickled our ankles. We wound through the undergrowth until the ground became soft and wet.

One of Elizabeth's bigger installations, a centaur made out of the bust of a discarded civil war general statue, towered over the trail. The centaur was on its hind legs kicking at the air. The lower half had been intentionally neutered by Elizabeth. The centaur's masculine anatomy had been chiseled off and dropped in the weeds beneath it. A commentary on the neutered lost cause, I assumed. At the base of the statute, near the discarded phallus, I laid the bag down in the long grass and waited.

Aphrodite stepped close to me and watched over my shoulder. She smelled like sunscreen, lemons, and alcohol.

With the rake, I teased the back of the bag and, a moment later, the snake slithered out of the opening.

"It's big," Aphrodite said.

She was right. "Heavy, too," I said. "I worked up a sweat carrying it here."</p>
